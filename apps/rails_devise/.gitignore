# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/test.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/tmp/pids/*
!/tmp/pids/
!/tmp/pids/.keep

Gemfile.lock

/public/assets
.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
# Adding it since this is only a test application
# and we need the same secret_key_base for the cookie to work.
# /config/master.key
