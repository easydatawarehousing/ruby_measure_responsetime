= roda-sequel-stack

This is an application skeleton for an app using Roda as the web framework,
and Sequel as the database library.  It's set up so you can clone this
repository and base your application on it:

  git clone https://github.com/jeremyevans/roda-sequel-stack.git my_app
  cd my_app
  rake "setup[MyApp]"

== Database Setup

By default roda-sequel-stack assumes a PostgreSQL database, with an application
specific PostgreSQL database account.  You can create this via:

  createuser -U postgres my_app
  createdb -U postgres -O my_app my_app_production
  createdb -U postgres -O my_app my_app_test
  createdb -U postgres -O my_app my_app_development

Using an application specific, regular database user account (not a
database superuser account), is recommended for security reasons.

== Next Steps

First, you'll want to edit the default migration file (+migrate/001_tables.rb+)
to define the database schema for your application.  After modifying the
migration file, and optionally adding additional migration files, you can run
the migrations:

  rake dev_up  # Migrate the development database up
  rake test_up # Migrate the test database up
  rake prod_up # Migrate the production database up

After editing the default migration file, you'll probably want to rename and
edit the default model file (+models/model1.rb+), as well as add other model
files as appropriate.  After the models have been set up, you can get an irb
shell with your models loaded:

  rake dev_irb  # IRB shell with models connected to the development database
  rake test_irb # IRB shell with models connected to the test database
  rake prod_irb # IRB shell with models connected to the production database

After editing the model files, you'll probably want to edit the
application file (+app.rb+).  You'll also want to rename and edit the default
routing subtree (+routes/prefix1.rb+).  After that, you'll probably want to
edit the layout (+views/layout.erb+) and index page (+views/index.erb+), as
well as add any other views.

After making those changes, you can start your application using +rackup+
or similar program.

== Libraries Used

roda :: web framework
sequel :: database library
rack-unreloader :: development code reloader
refrigerator :: freezes ruby environment in production (not enabled by default,
                modify config.ru to enable)
minitest :: testing framework
minitest-hooks :: around/around(:all) hooks for minitest
capybara :: web application testing helpers
warning :: warning filtering during tests

== Environment Variables Used

#{APP}_DATABASE_URL :: database connection URL to give to Sequel, default is to
                       create one based on the application's name and RACK_ENV.
#{APP}_SESSION_SECRET :: cookie session secret, must be >=64 bytes
RACK_ENV :: environment to use (production, development, or test), defaults
            to development.

== Specs

To run the specs for the application after running <tt>rake setup</tt>,
run +rake+.  To run specs for the stack itself (to test if the stack itself
is functioning as expected), run +rake+ before running <tt>rake setup</tt>.
